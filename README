TIMERBAR JQUERY PLUGIN

This plugin is a simple countdown timer bar that decrements a bar, right to left. The timerbar 
inherits the width and height of the element you use to encapsulate it, and allows you to set the
background (either image or color) and duration. An optional callback will execute when the 
timerbar finishes. 

An example of usage can be viewed using example.html in the project.

A full-featured example would be:


$('#mydiv').timerbar({
	'backgroundColor': '#ff0000',   //when image is present, color is used as a fallback for image
	'backgroundImage': './image.png',   //absolute or relative url to image to use, which is tiled
	'duration': 10000   //in milliseconds, 10000 (10 seconds) is default
}, 
function() {
	alert('this is the callback');
});


A few notes:
 - You can style the container div however you like. Use border, shadow, etc as you see fit.
 - Feel free to style the moving bar as you see fit, it is simply div.timerbar-innner
 - You can use an animated .gif as the background image
